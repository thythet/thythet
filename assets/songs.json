      "lyrics": "Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,\nThat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found;\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\n'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\nAnd grace my fears relieved;\nHow precious did that grace appear\nThe hour I first believed!\n\nThrough many dangers, toils, and snares,\nI have already come;\n'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home.\n\nThe Lord has promised good to me,\nHis Word my hope secures;\nHe will my Shield and Portion be,\nAs long as life endures.\n\nWhen we've been there ten thousand years,\nBright shining as the sun,\nWe've no less days to sing God's praise\nThan when we'd first begun."

      "lyrics": "O Lord my God, When I, in awesome wonder,\nConsider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy power throughout the universe displayed.\n\n[Chorus]\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nWhen through the woods and forest glades I wander,\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.\nWhen I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur,\nAnd see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.\n\n[Chorus]\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nAnd when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\nThat on a Cross, my burdens gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin.\n\n[Chorus]\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!\n\nWhen Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.\nThen I shall bow, in humble adoration,\nAnd then proclaim: \"My God, how great Thou art!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art.\nThen sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,\nHow great Thou art, How great Thou art!"
